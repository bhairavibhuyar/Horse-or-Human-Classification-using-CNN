# Horse-or-Human-Classification-using-CNN

This project utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to train a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a dataset containing images of horses and humans. <br>

CNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for image classification and computer vision tasks. The CNN architecture used in this project comprises 1 input layer, 5 hidden layers, and 1 output layer. <br>

The model accepts 300x300 images as input and accurately classifies them as either horse or human. Achieving a training accuracy of 0.9722 and a validation accuracy of 0.8789, the output displays uploaded images alongside their predicted classes. <br>

The output prints the uploaded picture along with its predicted class. <br>
